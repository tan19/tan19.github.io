\section{Graphical Models}
The motivation of graphical models is, in the previous settings, variables are assume to be (conditionally) independent of each other: such as observed variables $\x$ and/or $\y$; or latent variables $\z$ (excluding parameters $\btheta$). Graphical models consider the case when variables are correlated.
