\thm{
	Well Ordering Principle. Every nonempty set of positive integers contains a smallest member.
}

\thm{
	Division Algorithm. Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with $b > 0$. Then there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ with the property that $a = bq + r$, where $0 \le r < b$. (Note: $a$ and $q$ could be negative.)
}

\thm{
	GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) is a Linear Combination. For any nonzero integers $a$ and $b$, there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $gcd(a,b)=as+bt$. Moreover, $gcd(a,d)$ is the smallest positive integer of the form $as+bt$.
}

\cor{
	If $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, then there exist integers $s$ and $t$ such that $as + bt = 1$.
}

\thm{
	If $a \mod n = a'$ and $b \mod n = b'$, then $(a+b) \mod n = (a' + b') \mod n$ and $(ab) \mod n = (a'b') \mod n$.
