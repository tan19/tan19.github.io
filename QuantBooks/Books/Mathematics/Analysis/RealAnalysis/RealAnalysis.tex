\section{Introduction}
The core material of real analysis is that of Lebesgue integral, which extends the application of Riemann integral to a larger family of functions. The prerequisite of Lebesgue integral is measure theory. We begin from important concepts of sets, point topology, and the real number system, then continue with measurable functions before discussing Lebesgue integral.

\section{Real Number System}
The real number system can be characterized by three axioms: 1) the filed axiom, 2) the order axiom, and 3) the completeness axiom.

Of particular interest is the completeness axiom. Depending on the construction of real numbers, it can take the form of axioms (the completeness axiom), or a theorem from the construction. These include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Lease upper bound property
	\item Dedekind completeness
	\item Cauchy completeness
	\item Nested intervals theorem
	\item Monotone convergence theorem
	\item Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem
\end{enumerate}
