# Question
What is the expected number of tosses you need to see all six sides of a die?

# Answer
The answer is $6 \cdot \sum_{i=1}^6 1/i$. Let $X_i$ denote the random variable that tells us the number of trials it takes for us to see the i-th distinct side on a die. Obviously, $X_1$ is always 1, since the first roll gives us the first observed side. $X_2$ follows a geometric distribution with success p = 5/6. Similarly $X_i$ follows a geometric distribution with success p = (7-i)/6. So, the total expected number of rolls is E[X1 + ... + X6] = E[X1] + ... E[X6] = 6 * (1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/6).
