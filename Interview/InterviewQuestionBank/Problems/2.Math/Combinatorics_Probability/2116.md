# Question
The expected number of flips to see two heads from a series of fair coin tosses.

# Answer
Answer is 4 for to see two heads, and 6 to see two consecutive heads. Expected \# of flips to gets 1 H is just, E[X] = 1 + (1-p)(E[X]), where p is prob. of getting H, in the case of a fair coin this is 0.5, therefore rearranging you get E[X] = 1/p, meaning expected number of flips for 1 head is 1/p, for fair coin this is equal to 2. Since coin flipping is memoryless, expected number of flips to get k heads is just 1/p + 1/p + ... = k/p. Therefore 2/0.4 = 4, when k=2.
