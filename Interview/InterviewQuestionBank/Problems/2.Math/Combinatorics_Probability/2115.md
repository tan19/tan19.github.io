# Question
Expected number of die rolls until all numbers are rolled? If I have already made $N$ rolls, what is the expected number of distinctive numbers?

# Answer
This is the famous ``Coupon Collection'' problem. Define a set of variables $X_1, \dots, X_6$ where $X_i$ denotes the number of additional rolls need to obtain the $i^{th}$ new number, then the answer reduces to computing $\EEE[\sum_{i=1}^6 X_i]$. However, each $X_i$ follows a Geometric distribution where $p_i = (6 - (i-1)) / 6$ and $\EEE[X_i] = 6 / (6 - (i-1))$. Therefore,
\begin{align*}
    \EEE\left[\sum_{i=1}^6 X_i\right] = \sum_{i=1}^6 \frac{6}{6- (i-1)} = 6(1/6 + 1/5 + 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1) = 14.7
\end{align*}
In general, the answer for the coupon collection problem is:
\begin{align*}
\EEE = N\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{i}
\end{align*}

For the second part, introduce the indicator variables $Y_i$ to denote that if number $i$ is in the rolls already made. Then
\begin{align*}
\EEE\left[\sum_{i=1}^6 Y_i \right] = \sum_{i=1}^6 \EEE[Y_i] = \sum_{i=1}^6 Pr(Y_i = 1) = \sum_{i=1}^6 1 - \left(\frac56\right)^N = 6\left[1 - \left(\frac56\right)^N\right]
\end{align*}
