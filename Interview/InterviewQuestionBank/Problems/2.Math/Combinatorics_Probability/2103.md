# Question
In a hospital there were 3 boys and some girls. A woman gave birth to a child in the hospital. A nurse picked up a child at random and was a boy. What is the probability that that woman gave birth to a boy?

# Answer
\begin{align}
	P(\text{Boy} ~|~ \text{Picked a Boy}) &= \frac{P(\text{Picked a Boy} ~|~ \text{Boy})P(\text{Boy})}{P(\text{Picked a Boy})}\\
	 &= \frac{P(\text{Picked a Boy} ~|~ \text{Boy})P(\text{Boy})}{P(\text{Picked a Boy} ~|~ \text{Boy})P(\text{Boy}) + P(\text{Picked a Boy} ~|~ \text{Girl})P(\text{Girl})}\\
	 &= \frac{\frac{4}{3+N+1} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{4}{3+N+1} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{3+N+1} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}\\
	 &= \frac{4}{4+3} = \frac{4}{7}
\end{align}
