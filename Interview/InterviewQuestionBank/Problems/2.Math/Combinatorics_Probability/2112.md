# Question
There are $x$ people from country A and y people from country B. They sit around a table and shake hands with people on their left and right, but they only shake hands if they're from the same country. We want to know the expected number of handshake made.

# Answer
For each seat, the probability the person sitting there shakes the hand to the left is
\begin{align}
\frac{x}{x+y} \cdot \frac{x-1}{x+y-1} + \frac{y}{x+y} \cdot \frac{y-1}{x+y-1} = \frac{x(x-1) + y(y-1)}{(x+y)(x+y-1)}
\end{align}
Hence
\begin{align}
E\left(\sum_i Z_i\right) = \sum_i Z_i = (x+y) \cdot \frac{x(x-1) + y(y-1)}{(x+y)(x+y-1)} = \frac{x(x-1) + y(y-1)}{x+y-1}
\end{align}
