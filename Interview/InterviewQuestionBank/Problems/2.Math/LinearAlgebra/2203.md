# Question
Prove the Sherman-Morrison formula: $(I + uv^T)^{-1} = I - \frac{uv^T}{1 + uv^T}$ and the Matrix Determinant Lemma: $\det(I + uv^T) = 1+v^Tu.$

# Answer
We guess the inverse has the similar form $(I + uv^T)^{-1} = I + \alpha v^Tu$, thus
\begin{align}
(I + uv^T)(I + \alpha uv^T) &= I + auv^T + uv^T + auv^Tuv^T = I + u(a+1+av^Tu)v^T \\
&\implies a = -\frac{uv^T}{1+u^Tv}
\end{align}
and hence $(I + uv^T)^{-1} = I - \frac{uv^T}{1 + u^Tv}.$

If we look at the eigenvalues,
\begin{align}
    (I + uv^T)u = u + uv^Tu = (1 + v^Tu)u
\end{align}
We see that $u$ is an eigenvector and $1 + v^Tu$ is its eigenvalue. Moreover, there are $n-1$ orthogonal vectors (suppose $I$ is of dimension $n$) $b$ such that $v^T b = 0$, and for each of them we have $(I + uv^T)b = b$, which suggests that $1$ is the other eigenvalue with multiplicity $n-1$. Therefore, the determinant of $I + uv^T$ is the product of its eigenvalues, which is $1 + u^Tv$. That is
\begin{align}
    \det(I + uv^T) = 1 + u^Tv
\end{align}
This proves the Matrix Determinant Lemma.
