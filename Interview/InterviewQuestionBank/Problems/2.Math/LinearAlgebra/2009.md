# Question
Prove the Sherman-Morrison formula: $$(\I + \u\v^T)^{-1} = \I - \frac{\u\v^T}{1 + \u\v^T}$$ and the Matrix Determinant Lemma: $$\det(\I + \u\v^T) = 1+\v^T\u.$$	

# Answer
We guess the inverse has the similar form $(\I + \u\v^T)^{-1} = \I + \alpha\v^T\u$, thus
\begin{align*}
(\I + \u\v^T)(\I + \alpha\u\v^T) &= \I + a\u\v^T + \u\v^T + a\u\v^T\u\v^T = \I + \u(a+1+a\v^T\u)\v^T \\
&\implies a = -\frac{\u\v^T}{1+\u^T\v}
\end{align*}
and hence $$(\I + \u\v^T)^{-1} = \I - \frac{\u\v^T}{1 + \u^T\v}.$$	

If we look at the eigenvalues,
\begin{align*}
    (\I + \u\v^T)\u = \u + \u\v^T\u = (1 + \v^T\u)\u
\end{align*}
We see that $\u$ is an eigenvector and $1 + \v^T\u$ is its eigenvalue. Moreover, there are $n-1$ orthogonal vectors (suppose $\I$ is of dimension $n$) $\b$ such that $\v^T\b = 0$, and for each of them we have $(\I + \u\v^T)\b = \b$, which suggests that $1$ is the other eigenvalue with multiplicity $n-1$. Therefore, the determinant of $\I + \u\v^T$ is the product of its eigenvalues, which is $1 + \u^T\v$. That is
\begin{align*}
    \det(\I + \u\v^T) = 1 + \u^T\v
\end{align*}
This proves the Matrix Determinant Lemma.
