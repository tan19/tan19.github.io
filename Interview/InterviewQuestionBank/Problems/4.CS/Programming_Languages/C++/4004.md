# Question
What is the **sizeof** of an empty class? Follow-up: 1) why not zero? 2) what if I add a constructor and a destructor? 3) what if the destructor is virtual? 4) what if I add an int and a double? 5) what if I add an int and a double?

# Answer
(Usually) 1 Byte.

An object has to occupy some physical memory space, otherwise when you instantiate it you wouldn't be able to use it. The size of an empty class is usually 1 byte, but it depends on the compiler and system.

If we add a constructor and a destructor, the **sizeof** will still be one byte. If the destructor is virtual, the **sizeof** will be 8 bytes (in a x386-64 machine, which is 64-bit), since a **vpointer** will be added to point to a **vtable**.

If we add an int, the size will be 4 (in a x386-64 machine), but if we add one more double, the size will be 16, although a double takes 8 bytes and an int take 4 bytes. This is because of **padding**, i.e., shorter types will be padded to align with the longest type.
