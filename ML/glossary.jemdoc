- Model Evidence: Model evidence, or *marginal likelihood*, or *normalization constant*, is a likelihood function in which all parameter variables have been marginalized, usually denoted by P(D|M), or P(D) for short.
                  For example, in polynomial regression, M may denotes the degree of the regression function, and parameter variables are the coefficients for any given M.

- *Filtering* is the task of tracking the posterior distribution of the latent state varialbe in state space models.
