# Question
Given the following network environment, notice that the subnet mask of A and B is configured 255.255.255.224 instead of 255.255.255.0, what would happen if B pings A:
- Server A:
  -- IP Address: 192.168.26.129
  -- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.224
  -- Default Gateway: 192.168.26.2
  -- Default DNS Server: 127.0.0.1
- Server B:
  -- IP Address: 192.168.26.3
  -- Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.224
  -- Default Gateway: 192.168.26.2
  -- Default DNS Server: 127.0.0.1

# Answer
The answer is yes. When B pings A,
- the package will broadcast to find the MAC address of the default gateway (192.168.26.2) via ARP, since B thinks A is out of its subnet. Then,
- the default gateway will send B's ping request to A, and then,
- A will answer B's ping request directly (without going through the default gateway).
