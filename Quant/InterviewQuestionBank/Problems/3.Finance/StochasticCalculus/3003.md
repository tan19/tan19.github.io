# Question
What is the mean of the stopping time $T$ for a Brownian motion to reach either the upper level $U$ or the below level $-B$?
	
Follow-up question: One man at 17 meter of a 100-meter-long bridge. He has 50\% going one meter forward or backward. What is the probability he makes it to the end of the end of the bridge (the 100-meter end) before he reaches the other end (the 0-meter end)? What is the expected number of steps he takes to reach either end?

# Answer
The answer is $E[T] = UB$. Define:
\begin{align}
    T = \min\{t : W_t = U \mbox{ or } W_t = -B\}
\end{align}
Since a martingale stopped at a stopping time is a martingale, 
\begin{align}
    0 &= E[W_T] \\
    &= -B P(W_T = -B) + U P(W_T = U)\\
    &= -B P(W_T = -B) + U (1 - P(W_T = -B))\\
    &= U - (U+B)P(W_T = -B)\\
    &\implies P(W_T = -B) = \frac{U}{U+B}\\
    &\implies P(W_T = U) = \frac{B}{U+B}
\end{align}
Now, since $W_T - T$ is also a martingale, we see that
\begin{align}
    0 & = E[W_T^2 - T] = E[W_T^2] - T = B^2 P(W_T = -B) + U^2 P(W_T = U) - E[T]\\
    & = \frac{B^2U}{U+B} - \frac{U^2B}{U+B} - E[T] = UB - E[T]\\	
    &\implies E[T] = UB
\end{align}
For the follow-up question, the answer is obvious: the probability of reaching the end of the bridge is 17/100, and the expected number of steps to reach either end is $17 \times 83 = 1411$.
