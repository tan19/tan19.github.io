# Question
Compare **Naive Bayes** and **Logistic Regression**.

# Answer
NB has high bias as it focuses on a smaller set of models, converges faster but error rate may be high if assumptions are incorrect. Logistic Regression has lower bias as it allows a larger model space, converges to solutions slower but error rate can be lower due to low bias. Logistic Regression tends to be used a LOT more in industry but if your prior information is accurate (data is generated from a well known process), NB may be a better choice.

NB assumes that the input features are conditional  independent. NB also requires a prior distribution. Simple LR cannot do nonlinear classification.
