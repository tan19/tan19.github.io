# Question
A and B play table tennis. A has the probability of 1/3 to win a round. Suppose A wins the game if he can win 5 rounds but B wins the game only if he can win 11 rounds. What is the probability of A winning the game? What if, when the game is 10:4, one side has to win two more points to win the game (say, 12:4 or 10:6), what is the probability of A winning the game?
