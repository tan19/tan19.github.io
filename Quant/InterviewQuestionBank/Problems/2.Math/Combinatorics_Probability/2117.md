# Question
A tosses a fair coin $n+1$ times; B tosses a fair coin $n$ times. What is the probability that A has strictly more heads than B?

# Answer
The answer is 1/2. First observe that if A were to toss only $n$ times, then there are only three events:
- With probability $P_1$, A has more heads than B does.
- With Probability $P_2$, A has the same number of heads compared to B.
- With probability $P_3$, A has fewer heads than B does.

By symmetry, $P_1 = P_3$ and $P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1 \implies 2P_1 + P_2 = 1$. The additional coin toss A has increases the probability of A having more heads by just $0.5P_3$, hence the probability in question is $P_1 + 0.5P_2 = 0.5$.
