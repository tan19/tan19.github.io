# Question
You turn over a card one by one from a deck of 52 cards. What is the expected number of cards that you need to flip before you see the first ace?

# Answer
The answer is 10.6. Setup an indicator function $X_i = \mbox{all aces are behind card } i$. Then total number of draws is $N = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^48 X_i$, where $p(X_i) = 1/5$. The 1/5 comes from the fact that each non-ace card has a probability of 1/5 being appear before all aces.
