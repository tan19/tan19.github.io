# Question
There are 10 hunters and 10 ducks flying over. Each hunter aims at one duck and there is a probability of 0.5 that a hunter kills the duck he aims at. What is the expected number of ducks that have survived?

# Answer
The answer is 6 (but mine is 5?). Define a set of indicator variables:
\begin{align}
    Z_i = \begin{cases} 
    0, ~~ \mbox{if the ith duck has survived}\\
    1, ~~ \mbox{if the ith duck has died}		
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $i = 1, \dots, 10$. Additionally, we define $Pr(Y_j = i)$ to be the probability that the jth hunter aims at the ith duck. Now,
\begin{align}
    E\left[\sum_{i=1}^{10} Z_i\right] &= \sum_{i=1}^{10} E[Z_i] = \sum_{i=1}^{10} Pr(Z_i=1)\\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{10} \sum_{j=1}^{10} Pr(Z_i=1|Y_j = i) Pr(Y_j = i)\\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^{10} \sum_{j=1}^{10} (1/2)(1/10)\\
    &= 5		
\end{align}
