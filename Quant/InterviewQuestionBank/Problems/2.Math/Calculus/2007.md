# Question
Consider a polynomial $f(x)$ and its derivative $f'(x)$ that are related according to $f(x) - f'(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1.$  What is $f(9)$?

# Answer
Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial, so we may write
\begin{align}
    f(x) &= ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\\
    f'(x) &= 3ax^2 + 2bx + c\\		
    f(x) - f'(x) &= ax^3 + (b-3a)x^2 + (c-2b)x + (d-c)	
\end{align}
which implies $a = 1, b= 6, c = 15, d = 16$. Hence,
\begin{align}
    f(x) = x^3 + 6x^2 + 15x + 16.
\end{align}
