\section{Introduction}
{\em{Quadratic optimization problems}} (including, e.g., least-squares) form the base of the hierarchy; they can be solved exactly by solving a set of linear equations. {\em{Newton's method}} is the next level in the hierarchy. In Newton's method, solving an unconstrained or equality constrained problem is reduced to solving a sequence of quadratic problems. {\em{The interior-point methods}}, which form the top level of the hierarchy, solve an inequality constrained problem by solving a sequence of unconstrained, or equality constrained, problems.

Besides Newton's method, there are quasi-Newton, conjugate-gradient, bundle, cutting-plane algorithms, and etc.
