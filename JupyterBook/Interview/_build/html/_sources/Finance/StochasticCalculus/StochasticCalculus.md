## Brownian Motion

**Question:** What is $P(W_1W_{1+t} \ge 0)$, where $W_1$ is a standard Brownian motion?
<details>
  - <summary>Answer: </summary> 

Decompose $W_{1+t}$ into $W_1 + B_t$ where $B_t$ is an incremental Brownian motion independent from $W_1$, then:
\begin{align}
		P(W_1W_{1+t} \ge 0) &= P(W_1(W_1 + B_t) \ge 0)\\
		&= P(W_1 \ge 0, W_1 + B_t \ge 0) + P(W_1 \le 0, W_1 + B_t \le 0) \\
		&= 2P(W_1 \ge 0, W_1 + B_t \ge 0)\\
		&= 2P\left(W_1 \ge 0, Z \equiv \frac{B_t}{\sqrt{t}} \ge -\frac{W_1}{\sqrt{t}}\right)
	\end{align}
Now, draw a coordinate system with $W_1$ and $Z$, which are i.i.d. standard normal. The final answer is (need to check):
\begin{align}
		2\left(\frac14 + \frac{\arctan(1/\sqrt{t})}{2\pi}\right)
\end{align}

**Question:**  Solve $dr_t = a(b-r_t)dt + \sigma dW_t.$ Since the interest rate $r_t$ must not be negative, this is not a good model. Why the following well-known CIR model fixes this problem?
