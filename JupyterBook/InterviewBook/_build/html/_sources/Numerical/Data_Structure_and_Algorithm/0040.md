# 0040. Combination Sum II
[0040](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/)

Given a list of numbers, find **all unique combinations that sum to target**.

```
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
Output: 
[
[1,1,6],
[1,2,5],
[1,7],
[2,6]
]
```

## Initial Thought: What's the cost of a Brute-Force?
The naive way of solving this is of $O(2^N/N!)$, that is, each one of the $N$ numbers can be either in or out of a particular permutation, and since we do not care about the order, so there are $2^N/N!$ ways to try. However, this is computationally prohibitive, and we need to find a better way to solve this problem.

## Next Thought: Does pre-processing help?
Pre-processing:
- Sort
  - Sorting definitely helps, because 1) it does not compromise information from the original problem, and 2) it introduces useful information at minimum cost. 
- Hash
- Pre-sum

So the initial thought would be to sort and then use two pointers.

## Next Thought: Sort + Recursion
```
class Solution:
    def helper(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = []
        for i, n in enumerate(candidates):
            if i >= 1 and n == candidates[i-1]:
                continue
            elif n == target:
                ans += [[n]]
            elif n < target:
                reduced_Sol = self.helper(candidates[i+1:], target - n)
                ans += [[n] + x for x in reduced_Sol]

        return ans

    def combinationSum2(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        candidates.sort()        

        return self.helper(candidates, target)
```
