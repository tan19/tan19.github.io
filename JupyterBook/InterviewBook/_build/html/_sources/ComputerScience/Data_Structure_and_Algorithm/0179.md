# 0179. Largest Number
[0179](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/largest-number/)

Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

```
Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
```

## Initial Thought: 
- Brute-force? No. Since permutation takes $O(N!)$ which is prohibitive.
- Pre-processing? Sorting seems to be useful here. 

## Code
```
class Solution:
    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        nums = [str(n) for n in nums]
        L = 2 * max([len(n) for n in nums])                
        
        keys = [(n * L)[:L] for n in nums]
        
        sorted_ = [nums for _, nums in sorted(zip(keys, nums), reverse = True)]

        ans = "".join([s for s in sorted_]).lstrip('0')        

        return ans if ans else '0'
```
