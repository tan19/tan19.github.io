- <b>Airplane seating problem</b>
100 passengers are boarding an airplane with 100 seats. Everyone has a ticket with his seat number. These 100 passengers boards the airplane in order.
However, the first passenger lost his ticket so he just take a random seat. For any subsequent passenger, he either sits on his own seat or, if the seat is taken,
he takes a random empty seat. What's the probability that the last passenger would sit on his own seat? There is a very simple explanation for the result.

- <b>The Balance</b>
You have a balance and need to weigh objects. The weight of each object will be between 1 and 40 pounds inclusive and will be a round number. What’s the fewest number of
weights that you need to be able to balance any of these objects?

- <b>Burning Sticks</b>
A stick burns out in one hour from one end to the other. How do you measure 45 minutes using two such sticks? Note that sticks are made of different material and the burning
speed along different sections are different so you can't use the length of the burnt section to estimate time.

- <b>3 3 8 8 puzzle</b>
Using the four numbers 3, 3, 8, and 8, and the usual four arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division), can you make the number 24?
