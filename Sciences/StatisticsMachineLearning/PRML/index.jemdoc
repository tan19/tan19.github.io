- The main focus of this book is Bayesian Machine Learning (chapters 5, 6, and 7 can be skipped).
- The framework is graphical models (see [http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/prelims/ Jordan2015] and [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/Papers/WaiJor08_FTML.pdf WJ2008]).
- The inference algorithms are MCMC (see [http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~honavar/liumcmc.pdf Liu1999], [http://www.mcmchandbook.net/HandbookChapter1.pdf Geyer2011], and [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.2902.pdf RC2011]) and variational methods ([https://www.cse.buffalo.edu//faculty/mbeal/thesis/index.html Beal2003]).
- Kernel methods (see [https://www.amazon.com/Kernel-Methods-Pattern-Analysis-Shawe-Taylor/dp/0521813972 STC2004] and neural networks (see [https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618 GBC2016]) are briefly covered too.
- See [http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf RW2006] for Gaussian processes, and [http://stat.columbia.edu/~porbanz/papers/porbanz_BNP_draft.pdf Orbanz2014] for Bayesian Nonparametrics.
