- Q: How do you prove the existence of a stochastic process, e.g., Brownian motion, Gaussian processes?
- A: Kolmogorov extension theorem.

- Q: Unbiased v.s. consistent estimators
- A: Roughly speaking, "unbiased" is related to repeated experiments with the same number of samples while "consistent" is related to increased number of samples.
     Unbiased is "vertical", and consistent is "horizontal". There are examples that are biased but consistent, and unbiased but not consistent.
